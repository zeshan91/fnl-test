Routes
/ -> Default home page to get current weather for any city

API Routes
/api/city -> for City CRUD operation
/api/city-weather -> for fetching last 5 days weather info for 5 cities or by city_id request params for single city

Note: I did'nt get enough time to work on this as was on weekend. Worked on monday morning in 2 hours.

Improvements can be done if extra time:

1. Proper display of result to end user (may be using ajax or vue.js). currently i just rendered `main` key from api result on form submit
2. Test cases
3. API access restriction based on keys
4. Caching
5. Proper error handling if weather api does not return any response
6. proper bootstrap integration via npm. currently included via cdn
